CHAPTER CONTEXT:
- This is the second chapter in the Module 3 (Physical AI – Simulation & Synthetic Data)
- Readers have already completed Module 3 Chapter 1 (Introduction to Physical AI Simulations)

/sp.constitution
- This chapter focuses on NVIDIA Isaac Sim and its applications in robotics
- Target audience: Students with basic Python knowledge and ROS 2 installed, interested in simulation

DEFINE:

1. CHAPTER MISSION:
   - What is the primary goal of this chapter?
   - What should students be able to DO after completing it?

2. CORE PRINCIPLES:
   - What are the 3-4 fundamental concepts that MUST be covered?
   - What is the logical flow of concepts?

3. LEARNING OUTCOMES:
   - List 5-7 specific, measurable learning outcomes
   - Use action verbs: create, implement, explain, debug, analyze

4. CONTENT GUIDELINES:
   - Theory vs Practice ratio (e.g., 30% theory, 70% hands-on)
   - Number of code examples needed (minimum)
   - Types of visualizations required (diagrams, flowcharts, simulation screenshots)
   - Practical exercises count

5. PREREQUISITES:
   - What MUST students know before starting?
   - Which Chapter 1 concepts are essential?

6. SUCCESS CRITERIA:
   - How will we know students understood the material?
