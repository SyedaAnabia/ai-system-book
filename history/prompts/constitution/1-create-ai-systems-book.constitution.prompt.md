## Prompt

/sp.constitution Create a constitution for a technical book on "AI Systems in the Physical World - Embodied Intelligence". 

The book should cover:
- 4 main modules (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, Vision-Language-Action)
- Target audience: Advanced AI/Robotics students
- Practical, hands-on approach
- Include code examples, simulations, and a capstone project
- Each module should have 3-4 chapters
- Progressive difficulty from basics to advanced

Define the book's:
1. Core principles
2. Structure guidelines
3. Content style (technical depth, code inclusion, visual aids)
4. Learning outcomes

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive constitution for the AI Systems in the Physical World - Embodied Intelligence book, including six core principles focused on the four main modules (ROS 2, Simulation Environments, NVIDIA Isaac, Vision-Language-Action), plus hands-on learning and progressive complexity. Added sections for content guidelines, learning outcomes, development workflow, and governance policies.
